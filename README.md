# Contentful CMS 🗃️
> PROD [Live] : https://react-contentful-cms-v2-prod.netlify.app/

#### Contentful CMS consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a
- List of sections i.e. **Hero**, **Projects**.
- **Hero** consists of `Logo`, `Info` about the project. 
   - On `screens <992px`, the Hero will not have *logo*.
- **Projects** will have a list of cards where each card represents a link to the project with an `Image`, `Title` which upon click navigates the user to a specific project page.
- **`Loading...`** will be shown while fetching the projects, **`There was an error`** if any error has occurred.
- Data is handled by the headless CMS **`Contentful`** SDK and styles are handled by **`index.css`**
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.

#### Headless CMS

A headless CMS is a back-end only content management system that provides content creators with an intuitive interface for creating and managing content while leaving the front-end presentation layer to be handled by a separate system or platform. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as the content can be easily distributed to multiple channels and devices, without being limited by the constraints of a particular front-end system.
